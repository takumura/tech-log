Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).\r\n\r\n    To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.\\\\\r\n    Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.\\\\\r\n    (This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)\r\n\r\n- Unordered list can use asterisks\r\n- Or minuses\r\n- Or pluses\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to create links.\r\n\r\n```plaintext\r\n[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)\r\n\r\n[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com \"Google's Homepage\")\r\n\r\nURLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.\r\nhttp://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes\r\nexample.com (but not on Github, for example).\r\n```\r\n\r\n[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)\r\n\r\n[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com \"Google's Homepage\")\r\n\r\nURLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.\r\n<http://www.example.com> or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes\r\nexample.com (but not on Github, for example).\r\n\r\n### Internal Links\r\n\r\nFor anguler's limitation, I need to introduce another syntax to show internal link(link within the site).\r\n`[link text]{.internal-link link=link_path}`\r\n`.internal-link` is the css class to show internal link as a different style compare to external links.\r\n\r\n```plaintext\r\nFollowing link: [Move to Home]{.internal-link link=/docs/welcome} will move to initial home screen of this site\r\n```\r\n\r\nFollowing link: [Move to Home](/){.internal-link} will move to initial home screen of this site\r\n\r\nanother internal link example: [Move to Old Examples](docs/temp/example-old){.internal-link}\r\n\r\n### Anchor Links\r\n\r\nAnchor link will also working as same link syntax.\r\n\r\nanchor link: [Move to Links](docs/temp/example#links){.internal-link}\r\n\r\nanother anchor link example: [Move to Images](docs/temp/example#images){.internal-link}\r\n\r\nanchor link for another page: [Move to Old Examples - Links](docs/temp/example-old#links){.internal-link}\r\n\r\nJapaneses anchor is also available: [Move to Todo - サイトの更新](docs/temp/todo#サイトの更新){.internal-link}\r\n\r\n## Images\r\n\r\n```plaintext\r\nHere's our logo (hover to see the title text):\r\n\r\nInline-style:\r\n![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's our logo (hover to see the title text):\r\n\r\nInline-style:\r\n![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png 'Logo Title Text 1')\r\n\r\n## Code and Syntax Highlighting\r\n\r\nCode blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn't. However, many renderers -- like Github's and _Markdown Here_ -- support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. _Markdown Here_ supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).\r\n\r\n```plaintext\r\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\r\n```\r\n\r\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\r\n\r\nBlocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks <code>\\`\\`\\`</code>, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"plaintext\"><code class=\"hljs language-plaintext\">```javascript\r\nvar s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\";\r\nalert(s);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\ns = \"Python syntax highlighting\"\r\nprint s\r\n```\r\n\r\n```plaintext\r\nif syntax highlight is not required, please set \"plaintext\" to <b>lang</b>.\r\n```\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar s = 'JavaScript syntax highlighting';\r\nalert(s);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\ns = \"Python syntax highlighting\"\r\nprint s\r\n```\r\n\r\n```plaintext\r\nif syntax highlight is not required, please set \"plaintext\" to <b>lang</b>.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Tables\r\n\r\nTables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and _Markdown Here_ supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.\r\n\r\n```plaintext\r\nColons can be used to align columns.\r\n\r\n| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |\r\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\r\n| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |\r\n| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |\r\n| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |\r\n\r\nThere must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.\r\nThe outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the\r\nraw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.\r\n\r\nMarkdown | Less | Pretty\r\n--- | --- | ---\r\n*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**\r\n1 | 2 | 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nColons can be used to align columns.\r\n\r\n| Tables        |      Are      |   Cool |\r\n| ------------- | :-----------: | -----: |\r\n| col 3 is      | right-aligned | \\$1600 |\r\n| col 2 is      |   centered    |   \\$12 |\r\n| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    \\$1 |\r\n\r\nThere must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell. The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.\r\n\r\n| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |\r\n| -------- | --------- | ---------- |\r\n| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |\r\n| 1        | 2         | 3          |\r\n\r\n## Blockquotes\r\n\r\n```plaintext\r\n> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.\r\n> This line is part of the same quote.\r\n\r\nQuote break.\r\n\r\n> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.\r\n\r\nAnd the Quote with citation.\r\n> Quote here.\r\n>\r\n> <cite>-- Citation here</cite>\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.\r\n> This line is part of the same quote.\r\n\r\nQuote break.\r\n\r\n> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps.

You'll soon learn to get what you want. \"Markdown Toggle\" is your friend.\r\n\r\nHere are some things to try out:\r\n\r\n```plaintext\r\nHere's a line for us to start with.\r\n\r\nThis line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.\r\n\r\nThis line is also a separate paragraph, but...\r\nThis line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's a line for us to start with.\r\n\r\nThis line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a _separate paragraph_.\r\n\r\nThis line is also begins a separate paragraph, but...\\\\\r\nThis line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the _same paragraph_.\r\n\r\n(Technical note: _Markdown Here_ uses GFM line breaks, so there's no need to use MD's two-space line breaks.)\r\n\r\n## YouTube Videos\r\n\r\nThey can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:\r\n\r\n```plaintext\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE\r\n\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg\"\r\nalt=\"IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" border=\"10\" /></a>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:\r\n\r\n```plaintext\r\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)\r\n```\r\n\r\nReferencing a bug by #bugID in your git commit links it to the slip. For example #1."}
